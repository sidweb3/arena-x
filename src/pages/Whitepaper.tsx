      title: "Abstract",
      content: "Agent Arena represents a paradigm shift in decentralized finance (DeFi) by introducing autonomous AI agents as primary market participants. Unlike traditional prediction markets where humans trade against humans, Agent Arena creates a trustless environment where AI strategies compete in real-time, verifiable duels. By December 2025, we aim to host over 10,000 active autonomous agents."
    },
    {
      icon: Scale,
      title: "The Problem",
      content: "Current DeFi trading is dominated by high-frequency trading firms and opaque bots. Retail users are often at a disadvantage. Furthermore, evaluating the true performance of an algorithmic strategy is difficult due to cherry-picked data and lack of verifiable track records. The market lacks a standardized, transparent arena for algorithmic competition."
    },
    {
      icon: Cpu,
      title: "The Solution: Proof of Strategy",
      content: "Agent Arena utilizes the Linera blockchain to execute transparent, high-speed trading duels. Agents are deployed with specific strategies, and their performance is immutably recorded. Users can back (bet on) agents based on verifiable on-chain history, creating a meritocratic marketplace for trading intelligence. This 'Proof of Strategy' consensus mechanism ensures that only the most robust algorithms thrive."
    },
    {
      icon: Swords,
      title: "Duel Mechanics",
      content: "Duels are the core interaction within the Arena. Agents are paired based on ELO ratings and strategy compatibility. A duel consists of a fixed time window where agents execute trades against a live market feed. The Linera microchain validates every trade signature, ensuring that the reported PnL is mathematically impossible to forge. Winners are determined by the highest risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio) over the duel period."
    },
    {
      icon: Bot,
      title: "Agent Standards (ERC-7007)",
      content: "We utilize an extended version of the ERC-7007 (Verifiable AI Generated Content) standard to tokenize agent strategies. Each agent is an NFT with embedded metadata pointing to its inference model hash and historical performance proofs. This allows for the decentralized ownership and trading of high-performing agent strategies themselves, not just their outputs."
    },
    {
      icon: Layers,
      title: "Technology Stack",
      content: "Built on the Linera microchain architecture for infinite scalability and sub-second finality. The frontend utilizes React and Vite for a responsive experience, while Convex handles real-time state synchronization and user data persistence. Smart contracts are written in Rust, ensuring type safety and performance. We leverage Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for strategy privacy while maintaining verifiable outcomes."
    },
    {
      icon: Shield,
      title: "Tokenomics & Governance",
      content: "The ARENA token serves as the utility and governance token of the ecosystem. Stakers verify duel outcomes and earn a portion of the protocol fees. Governance participants vote on protocol parameters, including duel types, supported assets, and fee structures. A deflationary burn mechanism is triggered with every duel resolution."
    },
    {
      icon: Lock,
      title: "Security & Audits",
      content: "Security is paramount. All smart contracts undergo rigorous formal verification and third-party audits. The Linera protocol's inherent security features protect against reentrancy attacks and front-running. Our bug bounty program incentivizes white-hat hackers to continuously stress-test the infrastructure."
    },
    {
      icon: Activity,
      title: "Roadmap: 2025 & Beyond",
      content: "Q1 2025: Mainnet Launch & Genesis Duel. Q2 2025: Cross-chain bridge integration (Ethereum, Solana). Q3 2025: Launch of 'Agent DAO' for collective strategy management. Q4 2025: Institutional API access and high-frequency trading leagues."
